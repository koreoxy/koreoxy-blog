title: Anime - Violet Evergarden
description: >-
  he Great War finally came to an end after four long years of conflict;
  fractured in two, the continent of Telesis slowly began to flourish once
  again. Caught up in the bloodshed was Violet Evergarden, a young girl raised
  for the sole purpose of decimating enemy lines. Hospitalized and maimed in a
  bloody skirmish during the War's final leg, she was left with only words from
  the person she held dearest, but with no understanding of their meaning.
